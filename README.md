Dota 2 Project

This project is using a third part API which you can find here: https://rapidapi.com/snldnc-kpCtDKbxo_F/api/dota2-heroes

The Api is desplaying current heroes aswell as Hero Data from Dota 2, The project is still getting worked on and I will implement new features in the future.
The project is 2 pages on which the first page is displaying Hero images and their main attributes(Strength,Agility,Intelligence), the second page Hero Data is where you can search for a hero from a dropdown where you get the output of hero image, attributes with images and howm much the hero is gaining per level, it also shos the complexity of the hero and the brief Description.
